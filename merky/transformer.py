class Transformer(object):
    """
    Basic merkle tree inpired transform class.

    A `Transformer` can be given a nested data structure of arbitrary
    complexity, and will:
    - Walk the structure depth first
    - Calculate the sha1 (hex digest) of each distinct substructure
    - Yield the ``(sha1, substructure)`` pair to the caller
    - Substitute the sha1 for that substructure within its containing structure
    
    The top-level structure given is always yielded with its hash, whether it
    was complex or not.

    The depth-first walk will traverse anything that looks like a dict
    (that is, it implements ``iteritems``) or things that support
    iteration (implement ``__iter__``), with the exception of strings.  Strings
    are identified as anything that implements ``encode``.  Note that this means
    a ``json.JSONEncoder`` would be treated as a string, for example.

    Each structure is converted into a normal form, such that:
    * Strings, numbers, and booleans are left as is.
    * Dict-like structures get sorted by key and converted to
      ``collections.OrderedDict``.
    * Sequences get converted to `list` objects.

    This gives a result that can in principle produce a deterministic serialized
    form suitable for sha1 hashing.  Note that floating point values cannot be
    relied upon to give a deterministic result, and consequently they should be
    handled with care; consider converting them to string representations of
    fixed scale first.

    JSON is used for the serialization, and allows for unicode characters in
    strings and disallows the use of nan.
